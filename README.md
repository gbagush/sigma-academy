- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (with npm)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [MongoDB Server](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [SMTP Server](https://aws.amazon.com/id/what-is/smtp/)
- [Cloudinary API](https://cloudinary.com/)
- [Xendit API](https://www.xendit.co/)

### Setting Up

To set up the Sigma Academy project, follow these steps:

- **Clone the Repository:**

  Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the repository:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/gbagush/sigma-academy.git
  ```

- **Move to the Project Folder:**

  Navigate into the cloned project directory:

  ```bash
  cd sigma-academy
  ```

- **Install Dependencies:**

  Install the necessary dependencies using npm:

  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

- **Setup Environment Variables:**

  Create a `.env` file in the root of your project directory and set up your environment variables. Here‚Äôs a template you can use:

  ```
  # SITE CONFIG
  NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000 # FOR DEV MODE

  # MONGO DB
  MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/sigmaAcademy
  MONGODB_DATABASE=sigmaAcademy

  # JWT
  JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key_here

  # MAIL SERVER
  MAIL_HOST=smtp.yourmailprovider.com
  MAIL_PORT=465
  MAIL_SECURE=true

  MAIL_DOMAIN=yourmailprovider.com

  # Notification Account
  MAIL_NAME=Sigma Academy
  MAIL_USER=no-reply@yourmailprovider.com
  MAIL_PASS=your_secret_password
  MAIL_ADDRESS=no-reply@yourmailprovider.com

  # CLOUDINARY
  CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name_here
  CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
  CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret_here

  # XENDIT
  XENDIT_API_KEY=your_xendit_api_key_here
  ```

  Replace value with your own.

#### Development Mode

- **Start the Application (Development Mode):**

  After setting up the environment variables, you can start the application with:

  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

#### Production Mode

- **Build the Project:**

  First, you need to create a production build of your application. Run the following command in your terminal:

  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

  This command compiles your application and generates a `build` directory containing the optimized production files.

- **Start the Application:**

  After building the project, you can start the application using:

  ```bash
  npm run start
  ```

  This command will start your application in production mode, serving the files from the `build` directory.

#### Additional Notes:

- Ensure that your environment variables are properly set in your .env file for production use.
- You may need to configure a web server (like Nginx or Apache) to serve your application efficiently in a production environment.
- For optimal performance, consider setting caching headers for static assets as recommended in deployment best practices.
